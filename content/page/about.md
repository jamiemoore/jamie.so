It has probably been ten seconds since I last thought about computers in some way.

I am facinated by the connections between technical systems, including the developers, stakeholders and users of those systems.  

Sitting in a darkened room looking at a screen is pure fun and when the kids are safely in bed I like nothing more than coding, gaming or simply learning but it is always made better when someone brings me a cup of tea and excitedly asks what I am working on.

This website is primarly written for the engineers that I have met in my career as a way to thank them for our time working together by keeping notes that we will find useful.

I beleive there is more to be learned in listening than in talking, which is why I brought you this :tea:. Please [tell me](/page/contact/) what you are working on, I really want to know?
