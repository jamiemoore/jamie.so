# Hugo Repo for jamie.so

## Deployment

1. Make changes to this repo
1. Check them using `hugo server`
1. Deploy them using `./deploy.sh`
1. Commit them

## ToDo
We should pipeline the deployment so we only have to commit to the master branch of this repository.  Would be a great project when I next want to try out a CI system.
